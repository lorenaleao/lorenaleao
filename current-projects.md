# :sparkles: Participate in a programming marathon

## Description

In the first year, veterans present to us, freshmen at the time, the Programming Marathon. I always found it cool, especially because you get lots of opportunities to travel and I always wanted to travel the world. However, since that time I have struggled with start competing, start studying, talk to people that compete, participate in online contests, etc. (Just thinking about competing would made me anxious.) And I believe this has a lot to do with what Reshma Saujani talks about in [this](https://www.ted.com/talks/reshma_saujani_teach_girls_bravery_not_perfection) TED Talk. So, this year, which is the last year that I can compete for real, I decided to try to participate and go for it. Luckily, I found myself an all-girls team :) I hope it's fun! Cheer for us :crossed_fingers:

## Motivation

- Become a better programmer;
- Challenge myself to get out of my confort zone;
- Overcome some fears and insecurities.

I'm taking Competitive Programming this semester (2020/1), which is a discipline offered by DCC/UFMG and taught by professor [Vinicius Fernandes dos Santos](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~viniciussantos/). I'll put the files created along the way [here](https://github.com/lorenaleao/code-challenges).

# :sparkles: Learn a programming language really well (Go)

## Description

I feel that, despite knowing how to program in several programming languages, I still don't know one deeply. So, I chose to learn more about Go since it's the language that I'm using the most nowadays.

## Motivation

- Become a better programmer;
- [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sec-advice);
- Learn how to do cool stuff.

# :sparkles: Learn Bash

## Description

The goal here is to be more confortable using Bash and to find out everything I can do with it. 

## Motivation

I think it's really fun coding in Bash. The first thing I found to be VERY cool was to do this: control the state of my computer's LEDs by executing a command on the terminal.

```bash
echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/class/leds/input6::scrolllock/brightness
```

Purely Functional Text Editor

Description
I’ll build, using Rust, a Text Editor from scratch using Termion library. Also, this editor must support features that help functional programming such as insertion of holes and case splitting (Long term). Recording the process may be very interesting and helpful.


Motivation
There’s a lot of reasons for I want to do that. Here’s the most central:

Learn Rust (become a better programmer)
Build a larger project (learn about this process)
I honestly believe that there is yet no good solution to the problem of an editor for programming in functional languages
Probably will be of great help to enter in recurse.com

Long Term Goal Features:


Upsolve Marathon Problems

Description
There is a HUGE list of problems that I left unsolve from previous competitions. It’s not really necessary to solve all of them, the point is to never stay too much time without practicing and fill knowledge gaps.


Motivation
Go at least once to ICPC World Finals, perform better on other competitions and raise CodeForces rating :D

Study (Type Theory and Related)

Description
Continue the study started in IC with Maurício/Mário. There’s a lot of ways to go: Formalize stuff from TaPL, finish PLFA, read the blog about formalizing running time, dive into Homotopy Type Theory, search papers… And talk to Mario about POC! Okay, so little focus is bad. What about picking one to start? Finishing PLFA or reading the blog seems nice.


Motivation
I think this will be what I’ll do for life. Research and become an expert about dependent types and formalizing stuff, or entering into a company that works with it. It’s hard to start, but once I do, I’ll remember how this can be funny.

Learn a Functional Language (Haskell)

Description
Learn more deeply how to program using a functional language.


Motivation
This is related to the editor and type theory. Also, it already proved itself to be really fun.
