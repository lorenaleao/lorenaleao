âœ¨ I'm a back-end software engineer at Cyral with over 3 years of experience. I hold a B.Sc. in Computer Science from [Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais](https://ufmg.br/), where I also explored topics in Education, Culture, and Creative Processes. I'm passionate about building meaningful solutions and work mainly with Go and Python, I love tackling complex challenges and fostering a collaborative environment.

I'm driven by my curiosity to learn and my belief in the transformative power of education. Outside of tech, I'm interested in sociology, politics, and philosophy. I enjoy traveling, learning new languages, and connecting with different cultures.


<!--:sparkles: I studied Computer Science and took a series of courses related to Culture and Creative Processes at the [Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais](https://ufmg.br/).
