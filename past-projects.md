# :sparkles: Participate in a programming marathon

## Description

In the first year, veterans present to us, freshmen at the time, the Programming Marathon. I always found it cool, especially because you get lots of opportunities to travel and I always wanted to travel the world. However, since that time I have struggled with start competing, start studying, talk to people that compete, participate in online contests, etc. (Just thinking about competing would made me anxious.) And I believe this has a lot to do with what Reshma Saujani talks about in [this](https://www.ted.com/talks/reshma_saujani_teach_girls_bravery_not_perfection) TED Talk. So, this year, which is the last year that I can compete for real, I decided to try to participate and go for it. Luckily, I found myself an all-girls team :) I hope it's fun! Cheer for us :crossed_fingers:

## Motivation

- Become a better programmer;
- Challenge myself to get out of my confort zone;
- Overcome some fears and insecurities.

I took Competitive Programming in 2020/1, which is a discipline offered by DCC/UFMG and taught by professor [Vinicius Fernandes dos Santos](https://homepages.dcc.ufmg.br/~viniciussantos/). The files created along the way are [here](https://github.com/lorenaleao/code-challenges).

__TODO:__ Add how was it.
